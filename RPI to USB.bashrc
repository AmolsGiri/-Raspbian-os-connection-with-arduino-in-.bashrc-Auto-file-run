
""" The commands you've written ttyACM0 and /dev/ttyUSB0 devices. However, it's common for these devices to be owned by the dialout group, and giving permissions to the group is often a more appropriate approach."""

sudo chmod ug+rw /dev/ttyACM0
sudo chmod ug+rw /dev/ttyUSB0
#This sets read and write permissions for both the user and the group associated with the device.

#Additionally, if your user is not part of the dialout group, you can add it using:

#bash

sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
#After making changes to group membership, it's usually necessary to log out and log back in for the changes to take #effect.

#If you are still experiencing issues, make sure the device is connected, and you have correctly identified the correct #port (e.g., /dev/ttyACM0 or /dev/ttyUSB0).
